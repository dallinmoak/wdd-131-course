        Noah, this was supposed to be a simple select, i think. I'll admit I didn't pay attention in class to how the page ought to behave, so i went ahead and messed around a bit and made a carousel with interactions. I'm kind of proud of the implementation, check out <a href="./script.js">the script</a> if you want.
